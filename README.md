# MERN Heroku Example

This is a small template for building serverless React apps based on "Create React App" and Netlify Functions (AWZ Lambda Functions).

The technology stack resembles MERN but without express.js:
* Client is written in React
* Server is a collection of cloud functions
* Mongoose is used to persist data to MongoDB

The application does very little on it's own, but the project demonstrates how you can structure a simple serverless application for deployment.
